## New implementation of Linux PavUControl

### I'm trying to create a cross-platform application in order to totally control, flatten and equalize audio sound.

With the first intention make auto control and normalization of the audio from many tabs on Google Chrome browser Â 

---

**Use Caase 001 - "I, as an end user, want to automatically take control over the sounds of various Google Chrome tabs."**  
As you can do it manually, by Pavucontrol, I want to do this by a predetermined setting, and automatically level the sounds, based on the "Silence" level parameter shown in the UI of the src/channelwidget.h file to prevent that the sound of any tab exceeds the pre-set decibel level.

And with that and the help of the Flutter framework, in addition to some operating system implementations, create an open source application (Android, Apple, Linux, Windows, Web)
